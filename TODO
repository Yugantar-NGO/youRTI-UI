## 3. How to use the LLM hooks in this design

Because you said data isn’t the barrier, the layout should squeeze interesting stories out of *every* RTI you pass in:

For each RTI you feed the LLM, ask it to output:

* **Type**: `win` / `pending_high_impact` / `pending_normal` / `question_trend` etc.
* **Hook Title**: short, outcome-framed headline.
* **Why it matters**: ≤ 150 chars.
* **Impact metrics** (up to 3): each with `{icon, label, value}`.
* **Category**: topic, department, state, urgency.

Then map:

* `win` → “Big Win of the Week” / “Stories That Changed Something” cards.
* `pending_high_impact` → “Citizens Still Waiting” & “Most urgent unanswered RTI” card.
* `question_trend` → “People Are Asking This Week” hook line.
* Aggregated metrics → “System Pulse”, “Impact Meter”, “Insights & Trends”.
